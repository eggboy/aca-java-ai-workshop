# Use Azure Service Connector

Azure Service Connector helps you connect your application to other backing services. Service Connector configures the
network settings and connection information (for example, generating environment variables) between application services
and target backing services in management plane. Developers use their preferred SDK or library that consumes the
connection information to do data plane operations against the target backing service.

In this section, you will learn how to use Azure Service Connector to connect your Java application to Azure Database
for MySQL Flexible Server without exposing the connection string in the code. But Before we start, let's understand the
basics of the authentication mechanism with Azure SDK

## Basics - Application Authentication for Azure resources

When an app needs to access an Azure resource, the app must be authenticated to Azure. This is true for all apps,
whether deployed to Azure, deployed on-premises, or under development on a local developer workstation.

There are 3 approaches to authenticate an application to Azure:

1. Developer account - Identity obtained from VSCode, IntelliJ, Azure CLI or PowerShell
2. Service Principal - Identity obtained from Azure Entra ID
3. Managed Identity - Identity obtained from Azure Managed Identity

Deciding between service principal and managed identity depends on the scenario, but basic recommendation is to user
managed identity for every possible scenario and fall back to service principal only when managed identity is not
supported. Good example of it is, Apps hosted outside of Azure (for example on-premises apps) that need to connect to
Azure services.

## Basics - Why Azure Managed Identity?

Service Principal has been a common way to authenticate an application to Azure resources, but it has major caveat that
it is just the combination of id and secret. A common challenge for developers is the management of this service
principal. You might challenge this and say we could use Azure Key Vault. It's true that developers can securely store
the secrets in Azure Key Vault, But services still need a way to access Azure Key Vault which using service principal is
a security risk.

Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID for applications to use when
connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain
Microsoft Entra tokens without having to manage any credentials.

There are two types of managed identities:

- System-assigned. Some Azure resources, such as virtual machines allow you to enable a managed identity directly on the
  resource. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity:
    - A service principal of a special type is created in Microsoft Entra ID for the identity. The service principal is
      tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource. When the Azure resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the
      service principal for you.
    - By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.
    - You authorize the managed identity to have access to one or more services.
- User-assigned. You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned
  managed identity and assign it to one or more Azure Resources. When you enable a user-assigned managed identity:
    - A service principal of a special type is created in Microsoft Entra ID for the identity. The service principal is
      managed separately from the resources that use it.
    - User-assigned identities can be used by multiple resources.
    - You authorize the managed identity to have access to one or more services.

## Basics - Spring Cloud Azure(Azure SDK for Spring Boot)

Spring Cloud Azure is an open-source project that provides seamless Spring integration with Azure. When it comes to
authentication, Spring Cloud Azure uses `DefaultAzureCredential` which is intended to provide the simplifed
authentication for development and production environments. It is a chain of credentials that is tried in order
automatically, and the first available credential is used to authenticate. This approach enables your app to use
different authentication methods in different environments (local dev vs. production) without implementing
environment-specific code.

To configure managed identity with Spring Cloud Azure, below properties should be set in your `application.properties`
file:

```properties
spring.cloud.azure.credential.managed-identity-enabled=true
spring.cloud.azure.credential.client-id=<Client ID of Managed Identity>
```

## Passwordless Connection with Service Connector

Passwordless connections use managed identities to access Azure services. With this approach, you don't have to manually
track and manage secrets for managed identities. These tasks are securely handled internally by Azure.

Service Connector enables managed identities in app hosting services like Azure Spring Apps, Azure App Service, and
Azure Container Apps. Service Connector also configures database services, such as Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure
Database for MySQL, and Azure SQL Database, to accept managed identities.

### Create Service Connector

Previously deployed backend services are using in-memory database. In this section, we will create Service Connector to
connect the backend services to Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server as the database.

Let's create a Managed Identity for the MySQL database using Azure CLI.

```bash
az identity create --name aca-mysql-mi
```

Next, we start creating Service Connector from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). We will start with
vets-service.
Create a Connection following the screen below.

![DefaultAzureCredential](images/serviceconnector-1.png)

Choose the Managed Identity created in the previous step.

![DefaultAzureCredential](images/serviceconnector-2.png)

On `Revew + Create` page, it shows the command to create the Service Connector which would look like below.

```bash
az containerapp connection create mysql-flexible \
--connection mysql_a4696 \
--source-id /subscriptions/../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.App/containerApps/vets-service \
--target-id /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/.../providers/Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers/jay-aca-java-labs/databases/aca-labs \
--client-type springBoot \
--user-identity client-id=28237d6c.. subs-id=6535fca9.. mysql-identity-id=/subscriptions/.../resourcegroups/.../providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/aca-mysql-mi 
-c vets-service-build42982
```

Once you run the command, Service Connector will configure MySQL with passwordless connection, open the firewall rule,
and inject a few environment variables for the service type `springBoot` which is specified in the CLI command above. Go
back to Azure Portal and check the newly created Service Connector.

Do note that it injects the environment variable `spring.datasource.azure.passwordless-enabled=true` so that Spring
Cloud Azure can use the managed identity to connect to the MySQL database.

Last thing to do is to specify the SPRING_ACTIVE_PROFILE to `passwordless` in the vets-service.

```bash
az containerapp update --name vets-service --set-env-vars SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=passwordless
```

> üí° [!NOTE] 
> `passwordless` profile will automatically create tables on MySQL. Use client tools like MySQL Workbench to see the tables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Repeat the same steps for customers-service and visits-service**
