# Create AI-infused Java Apps with Azure OpenAI and Spring AI

In this chapter, we will explore how to create AI-infused Java applications using Azure OpenAI and Spring AI. We will start by setting up the necessary Azure resources and configuring our Spring Boot application to connect with Azure OpenAI. Next, we will implement a simple chatbot using Azure OpenAI's language models to demonstrate how AI can be seamlessly integrated into Java applications. Additionally, we will cover function calling with Spring AI, allowing our application to perform complex tasks by leveraging AI models.
